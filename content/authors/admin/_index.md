I am currently a research engineer working for the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation in Lyon, France.
My current research consists of applying machine learning approaches to wireless communications. However, my main interest lies 
on Spiking Neural Networks, and in particular on local learning rules that could be useful for AI.
